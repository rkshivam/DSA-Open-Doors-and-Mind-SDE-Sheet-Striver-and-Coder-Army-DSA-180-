# 🚪 DSA Open Doors & Mind — SDE Sheet Tracker

Welcome to my personal DSA journal — a curated collection of solutions, approaches, and insights from top problem sets like **Striver's SDE Sheet**, **LeetCode**, and **Coder Army's DSA 180**. This repo is designed to track my daily progress, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation for product-based interviews.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each problem folder contains:
- `solution.cpp`: My C++ implementation
- `approach.md`: Explanation, edge cases, time/space complexity

---

## 📅 Daily Progress Log

| Day | Problem | Difficulty | Status | Notes |
|-----|---------|------------|--------|-------|
| 1   | Merge Sorted Array | Easy | ✅ | In-place merge using reverse two-pointer |
| 2   | Two Sum | Easy | ✅ | Hash map optimization |
| 3   | ...     | ...        | ...    | ...   |
